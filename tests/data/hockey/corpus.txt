Kolzig on Samsonov Small biz gift guide ‘Jake Paul needs to fight a hockey player’ Ovi on Sergei’s athletic future

Olie Kolzig thinks Ilya Samsonov ‘has the ability to be like’ Andrei Vasilevskiy
Ilya Samsonov is the Washington Capitals’ goaltender of the future and the team’s de facto starter heading into next season. After winning 15 of his first 17 starts during his rookie season, the young Russian got consideration for the Calder Trophy at the end of the year. For Samsonov, the question isn’t if he will be a decent NHL player, it’s if he’ll be able to put it all together to be a top-tier talent in the league.

Capitals legend Olie Kolzig, the winningest goaltender in franchise history and currently a player development coach with the team, thinks the sky is the limit for Samsonov.

“I think Sammy has the ability to be like [Andrei] Vasilevskiy,” Kolzig said on the Capitals Talk Podcast last week.

Michael Latta tells Jake Paul to fight a hockey player next after brutal knockout of Nate Robinson
YouTube star Jake Paul knocked out former NBA player and three-time Slam Dunk champion Nate Robinson on Saturday. The bout was part of a fight night at Staples Center that was headlined by Mike Tyson coming out of retirement to throw hands with Roy Jones, Jr.

While Tyson’s fight was fun for what it was (it ended in a draw), Paul’s second-round TKO of Robinson sent social media buzzing.

Alex Ovechkin on his two-year-old son Sergei: ‘I have no doubt he will be an athlete’
From his puck-juggling to his powerful backhanded shots, two-year-old Sergei Ovechkin is clearly an advanced hockey player at his age. Sergei’s skills are so impressive that his dad, NHL legend Alex Ovechkin, is convinced that his son will someday make his living playing sports.

While speaking with Russian Television International earlier this month, Ovechkin spoke about his son’s talent in sports and how his parents supported and inspired him enough to reach the NHL.

How the Pittsburgh Penguins almost ended up selecting Nicklas Backstrom in the 2006 NHL Draft
Let’s flashback to 2006. The Washington Capitals delegation was sitting at its table on the floor of General Motors Place. George McPhee whispered a name into Alexander Ovechkin’s ear. “The guy you ran into at the World Juniors,” McPhee said. The Caps GM then fielded a trade offer from the Boston Bruins who dangled their number five and 37 overall picks to jump up to four and select “the Swede.” In the end, the Capitals passed on the deal and Ovechkin walked to the lectern on stage.

“Washington Capitals select Nicklas Backstrom,” Ovechkin, wearing the team’s black Capitol Dome jersey, said sheepishly into the mic.

On Friday, the Washington Wizards announced it would be playing a preseason game with no fans against the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, December 17.

A photo of the sweaters, which also featured a random Jeff Beukeboom jersey, garnered 57k-plus likes on the NHL’s Instagram page and the admiration of hockey fans everywhere.

CJ has a staggering 16 different Lundqvist jerseys — well, 17, if you include a Lundqvist home jersey that was signed, framed, and hung in CJ’s basement.

Kolzig on Samsonov Small biz gift guide ‘Jake Paul needs to fight a hockey player’ Ovi on Sergei’s athletic future

Olie Kolzig thinks Ilya Samsonov ‘has the ability to be like’ Andrei Vasilevskiy

BY Ian Oland 4 Comments
November 29, 2020 9:43 pm
Ilya Samsonov is the Washington Capitals’ goaltender of the future and the team’s de facto starter heading into next season. After winning 15 of his first 17 starts during his rookie season, the young Russian got consideration for the Calder Trophy at the end of the year. For Samsonov, the question isn’t if he will be a decent NHL player, it’s if he’ll be able to put it all together to be a top-tier talent in the league.


Capitals legend Olie Kolzig, the winningest goaltender in franchise history and currently a player development coach with the team, thinks the sky is the limit for Samsonov.

“I think Sammy has the ability to be like [Andrei] Vasilevskiy,” Kolzig said on the Capitals Talk Podcast last week.



Vasilevskiy is one of the best goaltenders in the league. The Russian goalie won the Vezina Trophy during the 2018–19 season and helped lead the Tampa Bay Lightning to their second Stanley Cup in 2020.


Kolzig praised the Capitals’ decision to bring in a veteran backup in Henrik Lundqvist and that it would help Samsonov develop quicker. The Caps were also considering giving the backup job to Vitek Vanecek who is a two-time AHL All-Star.


“With the shortened season last year and then obviously [Samsonov] wasn’t healthy when the playoffs started, there’s still a little bit of a question mark,” Kolzig said. “Not a question mark, but lack of experience with him. And so you need that veteran guy there to A, help guide him along but B, obviously step in.

“[Samsonov’s] still a young guy and he’s going to have some rough patches,” added Kolzig. “So you need that veteran guy that’s going to be able to get in there and do the job because we are still a competitive team that still have aspirations of winning another Stanley Cup and you don’t want to sacrifice that with having the growth of a young goaltender.”

The Capitals signed Lundqvist, 38, to a one-year, $1.5 million contract over the offseason after the New York Rangers bought him out. His resume is long. The King is the sixth winningest goaltender of all time (459). He won the Vezina Trophy in 2012 while being a finalist for the award four other seasons (2006, 2007, 2008, 2013). He led his Rangers to the Stanley Cup Final in 2014. Lundqvist has played in five different All-Star Games (2009, 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019) and has a foundation off the ice that helps kids who have health, education, and financial stability problems.

“You get a guy of Henrik’s stature and ability and what he’s done in the NHL and then you look at basically what you ended up getting him for and it almost seems like a no-brainer,” Kolzig said.

The only part of the goaltending equation that Kolzig didn’t like was seeing Braden Holtby leave the organization. Holtby signed a two-year deal with the Vancouver Canucks worth $4.3 million a season after the Caps’ decided to move on due to salary cap constraints.

“I was sad to see Holts go especially what he’s done for the organization,” Kolzig said. “I understand it’s a money deal and that is the crappy side of things, it’s the realistic side of pro sports because you do lose a great person in Braden.

McAvoy 'still sad' Krug left Bruins to sign with Blues
Says defenseman has been his mentor since entering NHL

Charlie McAvoy hasn't gotten over Torey Krug leaving the Boston Bruins and signing with the St. Louis Blues as a free agent.

"'TK' was one of the first people who took me under his wing right away from the moment I got there. We still work out [in the summers]," the Bruins defenseman said on the Cam & Strick Podcast. "He's just an unbelievable guy. Everybody [in St. Louis] is going to love him. … I'm still sad that he's not on our team, honestly." 

Krug played his first nine NHL seasons with the Bruins after signing as an undrafted free agent on March 25, 2012. Since 2013-14, his first full NHL season, he led Bruins defensemen in goals (67), assists (268), points (335), power-play goals (24), power-play points (159) and games (520).

But after signing a seven-year, $45.5 million contract ($6.5 million average annual value) with St. Louis on Oct. 9, Krug, who was an unrestricted free agent, said he had not received a contract offer from the Bruins in about a year. 

"It didn't work out [with the Bruins]. I was looking forward to having a conversation with them. It just didn't happen," Krug said.

McAvoy said Krug was one of the players who mentored him when he entered the NHL in 2017-18.

"It definitely doesn't really feel real, showing up to training camp that he's not going to be there," the 22-year-old said. "[St. Louis] got a [really good] hockey player. He's an unbelievably gifted defenseman, especially on the offensive side of the puck. He just sees the game so well. He's going to make the Blues a very good hockey team."

There's a possibility that Boston also enters this season without defenseman Zdeno Chara, who has been Bruins captain since 2006-07 and is an unrestricted free agent. Bruins general manager Don Sweeney said Monday they have had frequent communication with the 43-year-old but his situation hasn't changed.

"Nope. Same status quo there," Sweeney said. "Waiting to reconnect with (agent) Matt [Keator] and Zdeno. [He] continues to evaluate what the landscape of the League looks like, and we'll see where it goes. We've had constant communication, but hopefully we've got a target date (for this season) here at some point in time in the near future and we'll see what the League determines."

The NHL season is targeted to begin Jan. 1, 2021. McAvoy could have a much bigger role with the Bruins, including maybe replacing Krug on the first power play. 

"I'm definitely excited to be where I am and with this team," McAvoy said. "And I'm not really sure what's going to happen. This is kind of like a weird place to be. I [haven't] been in this position since I've been here where it kind of looks like we're restructuring a little bit on the back end.

"No one knows what's going to happen to [Chara] and all that. But whatever the challenge is, I know that I'll be ready for it."
